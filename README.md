# What is this project?
CRT Simulation
Given the length, plate separation, and potential difference across two horizontal parallel plates 
and the initial horizontal speed of an electron passing through the plates, calculate the electron's trajectory. 
Include calculations to verify that the electron's displacement is correct. 
What is the real-world relevance of such a calculation?
Assessment criteria: 
- Code is clear with comments and appropriate variable names
- Code can accept different inputs for given variables
- Output trajectory is clear and correct
- Calculations to verify the accuracy of the output are correct
- Identification of the real-world relevance is clear and correct

## Build and run the application
To build and run the development version of the desktop app, use the run configuration from the run widget
in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
  ```
*I recommended using java 21, other versions have not been tested
